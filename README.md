Here’s the complete guide to connect your Raspberry Pi to a Windows PC using a LAN cable and access it via the LAN port:

---

### **Explanation of the Setup**

When you connect your Raspberry Pi to a Windows PC using an Ethernet cable directly to the LAN port:
- Both devices must be on the same subnet for communication.
- A static IP address must be assigned to both the Raspberry Pi and the Windows PC since there's no DHCP server to assign addresses automatically.
- This connection creates a private network between your Raspberry Pi and the Windows PC, allowing services like SSH, file sharing, and web hosting to be accessed using the Raspberry Pi's IP address.

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

#### **1. Prepare the Raspberry Pi (Already Completed)**
- Ensure your Raspberry Pi is configured with a static IP address, e.g., `192.168.1.20`.
- Make sure SSH is enabled using `sudo raspi-config` and that any required services (like Samba for file sharing) are properly set up.

#### **2. Connect Raspberry Pi to Windows PC**
- Use a standard Ethernet cable to connect the LAN port of your Raspberry Pi to the LAN port of your Windows PC.

#### **3. Set Up the Windows PC**
1. **Assign a Static IP Address**:
   - Open the **Network and Sharing Center**:
     - Press `Windows + R`, type `ncpa.cpl`, and press Enter.
   - Right-click your **Ethernet** connection and select **Properties**.
   - Select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and click **Properties**.
   - Configure the following settings:
     - **IP Address**: `192.168.1.1` (you can choose another address as long as it’s on the same subnet, e.g., `192.168.1.x`).
     - **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.0`.
     - **Default Gateway**: Leave this blank.
   - Click **OK** to save.

2. **Test the Connection**:
   - Open Command Prompt (`Windows + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter).
   - Ping the Raspberry Pi's IP address to check connectivity:
     ```bash
     ping 192.168.1.20
     ```
   - If you see replies, the connection is working.

---

#### **4. Access the Raspberry Pi**
You can now access your Raspberry Pi using the following methods:

**a. Access via SSH**:
- Open Command Prompt or install **PuTTY** on your Windows PC.
- Use the following command to connect via SSH:
  ```bash
  ssh pi@192.168.1.20
  ```
- Enter your Raspberry Pi’s password when prompted.

**b. File Sharing**:
- If Samba is set up on your Raspberry Pi:
  - Open File Explorer on your Windows PC.
  - In the address bar, type:
    ```bash
    \\192.168.1.20
    ```
  - Log in using your Raspberry Pi credentials to access shared folders.

**c. Web Server Access (Optional)**:
- If your Raspberry Pi is running a web server:
  - Open your browser and go to:
    ```bash
    http://192.168.1.20
    ```

---

#### **5. Firewall Configuration (If Needed)**
- Ensure the Windows Firewall allows the required services, such as SSH and Samba.
   - Go to **Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall > Allow an app through the firewall**.
   - Enable access for SSH (port 22), Samba, or any other services running on the Raspberry Pi.

Following these steps, your Windows PC should successfully connect to your Raspberry Pi through the LAN cable, allowing seamless communication and access via its static IP (`192.168.1.20`). Let me know if any part of the setup needs clarification!
