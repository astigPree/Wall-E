Here’s the complete guide to connect your Raspberry Pi to a Windows PC using a LAN cable and access it via the LAN port:

---

### **Explanation of the Setup**

When you connect your Raspberry Pi to a Windows PC using an Ethernet cable directly to the LAN port:
- Both devices must be on the same subnet for communication.
- A static IP address must be assigned to both the Raspberry Pi and the Windows PC since there's no DHCP server to assign addresses automatically.
- This connection creates a private network between your Raspberry Pi and the Windows PC, allowing services like SSH, file sharing, and web hosting to be accessed using the Raspberry Pi's IP address.

---

### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

#### **1. Prepare the Raspberry Pi (Already Completed)**
- Ensure your Raspberry Pi is configured with a static IP address, e.g., `192.168.1.20`.
- Make sure SSH is enabled using `sudo raspi-config` and that any required services (like Samba for file sharing) are properly set up.

#### **2. Connect Raspberry Pi to Windows PC**
- Use a standard Ethernet cable to connect the LAN port of your Raspberry Pi to the LAN port of your Windows PC.

---

#### **3. Set Up the Windows PC**
1. **Assign a Static IP Address**:
   - Open the **Network and Sharing Center**:
     - Press `Windows + R`, type `ncpa.cpl`, and press Enter.
   - Right-click your **Ethernet** connection and select **Properties**.
   - Select **Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** and click **Properties**.
   - Configure the following settings:
     - **IP Address**: `192.168.1.1` (you can choose another address as long as it’s on the same subnet, e.g., `192.168.1.x`).
     - **Subnet Mask**: `255.255.255.0`.
     - **Default Gateway**: Leave this blank.
   - Click **OK** to save.

2. **Test the Connection**:
   - Open Command Prompt (`Windows + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter).
   - Ping the Raspberry Pi's IP address to check connectivity:
     ```bash
     ping 192.168.1.20
     ```
   - If you see replies, the connection is working.

---

#### **4. Access the Raspberry Pi**
You can now access your Raspberry Pi using the following methods:

**a. Access via SSH**:
- Open Command Prompt or install **PuTTY** on your Windows PC.
- Use the following command to connect via SSH:
  ```bash
  ssh pi@192.168.1.20
  ```
- Enter your Raspberry Pi’s password when prompted.

**b. File Sharing**:
- If Samba is set up on your Raspberry Pi:
  - Open File Explorer on your Windows PC.
  - In the address bar, type:
    ```bash
    \\192.168.1.20
    ```
  - Log in using your Raspberry Pi credentials to access shared folders.

**c. Web Server Access (Optional)**:
- If your Raspberry Pi is running a web server:
  - Open your browser and go to:
    ```bash
    http://192.168.1.20
    ```

---

#### **5. Firewall Configuration (If Needed)**
- Ensure the Windows Firewall allows the required services, such as SSH and Samba.
   - Go to **Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall > Allow an app through the firewall**.
   - Enable access for SSH (port 22), Samba, or any other services running on the Raspberry Pi.

---

Following these steps, your Windows PC should successfully connect to your Raspberry Pi through the LAN cable, allowing seamless communication and access via its static IP (`192.168.1.20`). Let me know if any part of the setup needs clarification!


Here's how you can proceed with setting up Wi-Fi on your Raspberry Pi, disconnecting the LAN cable, and accessing it over the network:

---

### **Setup Wi-Fi on Raspberry Pi**
1. **Configure Wi-Fi Settings**:
   - Open the terminal on your Raspberry Pi.
   - Edit the Wi-Fi configuration file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
     ```
   - Add the following lines, replacing `Your_SSID` and `Your_PASSWORD` with your Wi-Fi network name and password:
     ```bash
     network={
         ssid="Your_SSID"
         psk="Your_PASSWORD"
     }
     ```
   - Save the file (`Ctrl + O`, then `Ctrl + X`) and restart the Wi-Fi service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart dhcpcd
     ```

2. **Verify Wi-Fi Connection**:
   - Check if the Raspberry Pi has connected to Wi-Fi:
     ```bash
     ifconfig wlan0
     ```
   - Look for an `inet` IP address under `wlan0`. This is the Raspberry Pi's Wi-Fi IP address.

3. **Find the Raspberry Pi’s IP Address**:
   - If the IP address doesn’t appear, use the following command to find it:
     ```bash
     hostname -I
     ```
   - Note down the Wi-Fi IP address.

---

### **Disconnect LAN Cable**
1. Now that the Raspberry Pi is connected to Wi-Fi, it’s safe to disconnect the Ethernet (LAN) cable from the Raspberry Pi and Windows PC.
2. Ensure both the Raspberry Pi and Windows PC are connected to the same local Wi-Fi network.

---

### **Access Raspberry Pi Without LAN Cable**
To access your Raspberry Pi using the Wi-Fi IP:

1. **Scan the Network for Devices**:
   - Use a tool like **Angry IP Scanner** to confirm the Raspberry Pi’s IP address.
   - Open Angry IP Scanner, scan your local network, and look for the Raspberry Pi (hostname might appear as "raspberrypi").

2. **Access Via Command Prompt**:
   - Open Command Prompt on your Windows PC and ping the Raspberry Pi’s Wi-Fi IP to ensure connectivity:
     ```bash
     ping <Wi-Fi_IP>
     ```
   - If you get replies, you’re ready to access the Raspberry Pi.

3. **Access Services**:
   - **SSH**:
     ```bash
     ssh pi@<Wi-Fi_IP>
     ```
     Enter the Raspberry Pi’s password to log in.
   - **File Sharing**:
     - Open File Explorer on your PC and enter:
       ```bash
       \\<Wi-Fi_IP>
       ```

---

### **Important Note**
Accessing the Raspberry Pi via its IP address requires that both devices remain on the same local network (same Wi-Fi). You’re now fully set up to use the Raspberry Pi wirelessly. Let me know if you face any challenges!
