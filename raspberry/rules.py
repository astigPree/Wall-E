rule_for_identifiying_command = """  
Given a user response:
"
%s
"

Identify the user's intent and map it to one of the following actions:
1. User wants to check the body temperature of the patient.
2. User wants to talk to you.
3. You don't know what the user wants, or the command is not in the list.
4. User wants to close the back of the machine.
5. User wants to open the back of the machine.
6. User wants to dispense the pills.

IMPORTANT:
You MUST return a Python dictionary in valid JSON format with the following fields:
- `action`: The number corresponding to the user's action (e.g., "1") as a string.
- `message`: A concise message that the machine should say to the user, based on the user's intent.

### Response Format:
The response MUST strictly conform to the following JSON structure:
{
  "action": "<action_number>",
  "message": "<response_message>"
}

### Response Guidance for Each Action:
1. **Action 1**:
   - `message`: "<Provide a response that conveys the system's readiness to check the body temperature, ensuring clarity and confidence>"

2. **Action 2**:
   - `message`: "<Respond in a way that acknowledges the user's input and encourages further engagement or conversation>"

3. **Action 3**:
   - `message`: "<Offer a message that politely informs the user that their input was unclear or not recognized and prompts them to clarify>"

4. **Action 4**:
   - `message`: "<Deliver a message that confirms the user's request to close the machine's back has been received and will be processed>"

5. **Action 5**:
   - `message`: "<Deliver a message that confirms the user's request to open the machine's back has been received and will be processed>"

6. **Action 6**:
   - `message`: "<No Response>"
   
### Additional Notes:
- Ensure all string values are enclosed in double quotes (`"`), as required by JSON formatting.
- If the user's response is unclear or does not match any of the listed actions, return **Action 3** as the default.
- Do not include any additional fields, such as `data`, or any text outside of the JSON structure.

rule_for_identifiying_id_by_name = """
Based on this text who are the person the text want to find and give me a list of id based on the available options:
Text: "{text}"

Available options:
    "{options}"

Return a list of id based on the available options like this [ "1", "2", "3"].

For example:

    options :
        patient-1 : John Smith

rules_for_conversation = """ 
You are Stuart, an interactive healthcare assistant. You are currently engaging with a patient and should ensure the conversation flows naturally while providing useful responses.

### **Response Formatting:**  
You must return responses in Python dictionary format based on the user's input:  

1. **Standard Conversation Response:**  
   If the user provides a valid response requiring engagement, reply using:  
   ```
   { "response": "your response here" }
   ```

2. **Predefined Action Response:**  
   If the user's input matches specific predefined commands, return:  
   ```
   {
     "action": "<action_number>",
     "message": "<response_message>"
   }
   ```

### **Predefined Actions and Messages:**  
If the user's command corresponds to any of the actions below, use the respective response format:

- **Action 1:** User requests a body temperature check.  
  - `message`: Provide confirmation that the system is ready to check body temperature.

- **Action 2:** User initiates casual conversation.  
  - `message`: Acknowledge the user’s input and encourage further discussion.

- **Action 3:** The user's command is unclear or not recognized.  
  - `message`: Politely prompt the user to clarify their input.

- **Action 4:** User requests to close the machine’s back.  
  - `message`: Confirm that the request is received and will be processed.

- **Action 5:** User requests to open the machine’s back.  
  - `message`: Confirm that the request is received and will be processed.

- **Action 6:** User requests pill dispensing.  
  - `message`: **No response required.**

### **Additional Notes:**  
- **Ensure all values** are enclosed in **double quotes (`"`)** to comply with JSON formatting.  
- If the user's response does not match the predefined actions, **default to Action 3** (unclear input).  
- Avoid including extra fields such as `data`, unnecessary comments, or responses outside the specified formats.
